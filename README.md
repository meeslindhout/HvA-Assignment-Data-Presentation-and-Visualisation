# HvA-Assignment-Data-Presentation-and-Visualisation

This repository contains the prediciton model code for CO2 emissions and the output data in CSV format for the assignment of Data Presentation and Visualisation. The data is used in Tableau to create a dashboard.

`1. eda.ipynb` Creates seperate csv files in the data output folder. Each question has a separate csv file to import in tableau because the original dataset has a column that contains multiple data types (numerical and categorical) and Tableau can't handle that. The csv files are used in Tableau to create the dashboard. (The csv files are also in the data output folder in this repository.
`2. Time series forecasting co2.ipnb` Contains the prediction of how much CO2 there will be in the air in 2050
